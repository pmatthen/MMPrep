Part 1
======
Watch “Foundations of Programming: Fundamentals” at Lynda.com and then answer
the following questions:

1. Imagine asking a friend to meet you at a restaurant. What instructions would 
   a computer program need that your friend would not in order to understand how
   to get there?
   
**A computer program requires a very descriptive set of instructions that are basic and exact. Even one incorrect instruction could result in an incorrect destination.**

2. What is the difference between source code and machine code? What does the CPU do? Where are instructions and data stored?
   
**Source code is made up of text/syntax that is part of a programming language. Programmers work with source code. Source code has been designed to resemble the English language. In order for the source code to be usable by a computer, it must be compiled into machine code. Machine code is the set of instructions and data directly used by a computers CPU. It is made up of many many very specific instructions.

A CPU interprets, processes, and delegates (to various components in the computer) instructions and it's associated data. The instructions and data are stored in the RAM, and Hard Drive.**

3. What is an IDE and why is it useful?

**An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment. An IDE aids a programmer in a number of ways. Some of these ways include, but are not limited to: 
- Warning the users about errors, practically in real-time.
- Auto-completing various types of syntax.
- Integrated debugging
- One click compiling

Essentially, an IDE is a collection of tools that makes a tough job a little bit more manageable.**

4. What kind of a language is Objective-C? Why do you think we use it for making
   device specific applications? Why wouldn't we want to use an interpreted
   language for making iPhone and iPad apps?
   
**Objective-C is a compiled language. 

We use it for making device specific applications, because it runs faster, and we don't have to share our source code. 

We wouldn't want to use an interpreted language for making iPhone and iPad apps, because we wouldn't benefit from the main advantage of interpreted languages, namely that they are built to be run on any type of platform. Additionally, we would also have to share our source code, and the programs would be slower.**
